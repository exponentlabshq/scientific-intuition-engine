## Scientific Intuition Engine (UMPF)

### Purpose
Turn canonical scientific sources into auditable knowledge that travels: from a Nobel‑level paper to a pair of artifacts that anyone can verify, compare, and build upon. The engine privileges fidelity (verbatim text) and structure (formal analysis) so insight is transferable across domains without losing grounding.

### What This Is (and why it matters)
- A fidelity‑first transformation of primary literature into:
  - a citation‑grade substrate (verbatim text), and
  - a structured UMPF analysis (category‑theoretic framing).
- A portable, reproducible way to compare discoveries across disciplines using the same conceptual language.
- A bridge from “story of a result” to “map of its structure,” enabling cross‑domain transfer without erasing provenance.

### The UMPF Frame (from the thesis)
UMPF is a universal lens for complex systems:
- **Monads (computation patterns)**
  - Maybe: uncertainty/absence
  - State: evolution/learning
  - IO: boundary/interaction
  - Free: orchestration/composition
- **Graphs (relational topology)**
  - Components and interactions; connectivity, modularity, dynamics
- **Lenses (focused transformation)**
  - Composable get/set on subsystems; lawful access to state
- **Four‑Layer Hierarchy**
  - Atomic → Domain → Control → Orchestration
- **Domain Classification**
  - Physical, Informational, Human/Social, Creative (recurring monad/graph/lens signatures)

### What the Current Artifacts Show
- A Nobel‑level primary source was re‑expressed as:
  - Verbatim text (title, authors, DOI, license, narrative intact)
  - A structured analysis that uses definitions, mappings, and a common sectioning (e.g., “7.2 Technology Development”)—turning narrative into structure.
- Result: a pair of artifacts that are traceable (back to the source), comparable (across papers), and useful (for cross‑domain reasoning).

### Why This Changes the Work
- **From anecdote to algebra**: Formal sections and mappings force clarity and make results comparable without flattening their meaning.
- **From isolated papers to a shared atlas**: The same scaffold applies to quantum physics, immunology, distributed systems, etc.—different content, identical structure.
- **From opinion to audit**: The verbatim substrate anchors truth; the analysis is a claim against that anchor. Peer‑review notes complete the loop.

### Promises and Principles
- Keep the original voice available (verbatim). Never force interpretation without evidence.
- Constrain interpretation with a shared schema (UMPF) so comparisons are fair and productive.
- Prefer portability: plain text, Markdown, human‑readable structure that any model or colleague can pick up.

### What This Enables Next
- Rapid, comparable analyses of additional primary sources—across Nobel domains and beyond.
- Cross‑domain transfers: importing mechanisms and constraints from one field to another with fewer translation losses.
- Programmatic meta‑analysis: searching the structured corpus for repeating monadic/graph/lens patterns.

### How to Engage (high‑level)
- Bring a primary source. Expect a verbatim anchor and a structured re‑expression.
- Critique at two levels: facts (the text) and structure (the mapping). Improve either without breaking the other.
- Use the shared language (monads, graphs, lenses, layers) to propose cross‑domain hypotheses that are testable and comparable.
