The Nobel committee announced on October 4th that Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger 
were awarded the Nobel prize “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of 
Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science” [1]. In this article, we want to put the 
Nobel Prize in perspective, and replace the three laureates’ contribution in their historical context.

T he development of Quantum 

Physics during the 20th centu-
ry is certainly one of the most 
extraordinary intellectual adven-
tures of mankind. This theory has 
deeply modified our conception of 
the world, and it has had in parallel 
a strong impact on our life with its 
numerous applications: transistors, 
lasers, integrated circuits. One cor-
nerstone of quantum science is the 
concept of photons, introduced in 
1905 (see [2]) and one of the most 
prominent features of the quantum 
formalism is entanglement (a term 

coined by Schrödinger). Einstein, 
Podolsky and Rosen pointed out its 
subtle and paradoxical character in 
a celebrated paper. They used this 
notion to demonstrate the conflict 
between quantum mechanics and 
a realistic local theory of the phy-
sical world. Moreover, to the ques-
tion “Can a quantum-mechanical 
description of physical reality be 
considered complete?” the answer 
of Einstein and co-authors was ne-
gative,  and  their  conclusion  was 
incompatible with the “orthodox” 
point of view, advocated in particular 

by N. Bohr. This conflict between 
Einstein and Bohr lasted until the 
end of their lives; it remained a phi-
losophical question until the work 
of J.S. Bell in 1964. Bell proved that 
the correlations between any pair of 
physical quantities, when calculated 
within a realistic local theory, are 
constrained by a specific inequality, 
which can be violated by quantum 
mechanics. From this moment, the 
above-mentioned conflict was no 
longer a matter of taste, but it be-
came a quantitative question that 
could be settled experimentally.

one of us (SG) was at one of the epi-
centers of this revolution, and wit-
nessed the vitality of the field, and the 
breadth of its application, spanning 
also well beyond optics, to atoms, 
superconductors  and  mechanical 
systems. Although very little doubts 
remain about local realism, the quest 
to experimentally close all potential 
loopholes continued, and remains 
to date an important topic, both as 
a fundamental subject, but also of 
practical importance, as pointed out 
by Alain Aspect in his 2015 perspec-
tive paper [6]. 
Beyond their crucial contributions 
for which the prize was awarded, 
one can also stress the importance 
and diversity of the three Laureates’s 
other  contributions  to  quantum 
science, for instance for Alain Aspect, 
the Bose-Einstein condensation of 
Helium or the Anderson localization 
of Atoms, to name just two salient 
examples.  Another  lasting  legacy 
is the many outstanding PhD stu-
dents and postdoctoral researchers 
that they formed over decades, and 
who continue to dynamize the field. 
The impact of the findings of these 
three physicists over our vision of 
the world is tremendous and it goes 
actually far beyond the Physics com-
munity. Philosophers and epistemo-
logists have now incorporated all 
these results in their own works and 
concepts. The hope of Einstein for a 
local and realistic description of the 
physical world has failed, and quan-
tum mechanics is in perfect agree-
ment with experimental results on

two key articles [4], to which one of 
us (JD) was lucky to be associated,

Anton  Zeilinger  realized  in 
Innsbruck in 1997 the first quantum 
teleportation experiment, followed 
in 1998 by the third key experiment 
on Bell inequality violations with 
photons, by using ultrafast and ran-
dom settings of the analyzers, thus 
enforcing so-called “strict Einstein 
locality conditions” [5]. As a postdoc

THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS 2022

This is when John Clauser enters 
into the story : first, as a graduate 
student at Columbia University, when 
he found a modified version of Bell’s 
theorem with an inequality that can 
be applied to practical experiments 
(using pairs of entangled photons 
and measurement over various po-
larizations),  then in 1972 when he 
performed with Stuart Freedman at 
the University of Berkeley the first ex-
periment that conclusively showed 
a  violation  of  Bell’s  inequality  by 
more than 5 standard deviations [3]. 
This experiment, which was using a 
lamp to excite the atoms (pre-laser 
era!) was a tour-de-force with a data 
acquisition time of 200 hours. The re-
sult of Clauser was later confirmed 
with a similar experiment by Fry and 
Thompson in 1976. 
In the meantime, starting in 1974, 
Alain Aspect engaged in a program 
in which the independence between 
the polarization measurements on 
each photon of the pair was enforced 
by a relativistic argument. In these 
experiments realized at Institut d’Op-
tique in Orsay, the setting of each po-
larizer was changing rapidly in time, 
so that there was no possibility that 
an information about this setting is 
exchanged between the two detection 
channels: The choice of the measure-
ment basis for the photons polari-
zation was done well after the pair 
of entangled photons was created 
and the locality condition, which 
is an essential hypothesis of Bell's 
theorem, becomes a consequence 
of Einstein’s causality that prevents 
any faster-than-light influence. This 
resulted in the publication in 1982 of

this matter. The results of Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger 
are now at the core of several modern textbooks in quan-
tum mechanics.
These seminal works crowned by the Nobel prize did not re-
main limited to closing a philosophical debate or to textbooks, 
but were rapidly followed by a stream of applications of en-
tanglement, and to the birth of a blooming field, quantum 
information processing, that spans from teleportation, to 
quantum cryptography, to quantum computing. All these 
feats rely heavily, at their core, on the phenomenon of quan-
tum entanglement and on non-locality.  Quantum informa-
tion processing is now a very active field worldwide, involving 
thousands of groups, and poised to revolutionize the way we 
communicate and compute. Quantum communications, be 
it on deployed fibered networks spanning across countries 
(and enabled by meshes of “quantum repeaters”), or along 
free-space link through satellites, are already a reality for un-
conditionally-secure cryptography. Quantum computing has 
recently demonstrated over different platforms the so-called 
“quantum advantage”: its capacity to perform some specific 
calculations with an exponential speedup over conventional 
computers.  While a large-scale universal quantum computer 
remains years away, the world is already getting prepared for 
the “post-quantum” era, where quantum technologies may 
render several of our current approaches to information pro-
cessing obsolete.For example, it is reasonable to expect that 
quantum simulators could soon be used to solve currently 
intractable problems in chemistry and physics, with crucial 
applications such as the design of new drug molecules.
It remains a humbling lesson to witness how such a pro-
found technological and societal change may stems from 
sheer curiosity-driven research : from the  deep philosophi-
cal considerations of the founders of quantum mechanics, 
later formalized by John Bell into measurable quantities, 
and ultimately to the experiments imagined by Alain 
Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger.
